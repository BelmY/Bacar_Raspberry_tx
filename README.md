This board is now compleet. Testing will start shortely.

This repository will have all the files for the PCB that fits on a Raspberry Pi witch will have a 7 stage low pass filter for the VHF 2m band. (About 60db down for first harmonic) 
It also now include a Mini Circuits low pass filter so you could use this board for two bands.
To Do.
1) Raspberry pin connection check
2) DRC and ref text placement

This board is to be used with the rpitx utility to alow you to transmit on the 2m VHF band.
This board will have 7 stage lowpass filter.
Here is the filter design details.

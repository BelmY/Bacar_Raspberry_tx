This repository will have all the files for the PCB that fits on a Raspberry Pi witch will have a 7 stage low pass filter for the VHF 2m band. (About 60db down for first harmonic) 

This board is to be used with the rpitx utility to alow you to transmit on the 2m VHF band.
This board will have 7 stage lowpass filter.
Here is the filter design details.
